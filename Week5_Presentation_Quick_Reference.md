# BlinkTalk Week 5 - Quick Reference Card
## For Your Presentation

---

## 🎯 **Key Points to Emphasize**

### **Problem Solved**
- Different users have different blink patterns and timing
- One-size-fits-all approach doesn't work for assistive communication
- Created calibration profiles to accommodate user diversity

### **Technical Innovation**
- **Real-time Switching**: Profile changes take effect immediately
- **Thread Safety**: Multiple users can switch profiles safely
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Blink detection adapts without restart
- **Comprehensive API**: Complete calibration management

---

## 📊 **Demo Script (7 minutes)**

### **1. Show Calibration Profiles (1 min)**
```bash
# Display the two profiles and their differences
Slow Profile:   500ms short, 1200ms long, 600ms symbol gap, 1500ms word gap
Medium Profile: 350ms short, 900ms long, 450ms symbol gap, 1100ms word gap
```

### **2. API Demo (2 min)**
```bash
# Start API server
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8011

# Get initial info
curl -X GET http://localhost:8011/api/calibration/info

# Switch to slow profile
curl -X POST http://localhost:8011/api/calibration/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"profile": "slow"}'

# Switch to medium profile
curl -X POST http://localhost:8011/api/calibration/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"profile": "medium"}'
```

### **3. Live Demo (3 min)**
```bash
# Run the comprehensive demo
python demo_week5.py
```

### **4. Show Test Results (1 min)**
```bash
# Run calibration tests
python -m pytest tests/test_calibration.py tests/test_calibration_integration.py -v
# Show: 34/34 tests passing
```

## 🗣️ **Speaking Points**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Today I'll demonstrate the BlinkTalk calibration system, which allows users with different blink patterns to use the system effectively by switching between slow and medium profiles."

### **Problem Statement (1 minute)**
"Not all users blink at the same speed. Some users have slower blink patterns due to various conditions. Our solution provides calibration profiles that adjust the timing thresholds to match each user's capabilities."

### **Technical Solution (2 minutes)**
"I implemented a calibration manager with two profiles - slow and medium - that can be switched in real-time via API. The system immediately adapts blink detection thresholds without requiring a restart, and it's thread-safe for multiple users."

### **Demo (3 minutes)**
"Let me show you the system in action. I'll demonstrate profile switching, threshold differences, and how the same blink pattern is classified differently based on the active profile."

### **Results (1 minute)**
"All 34 tests are passing, including 20 unit tests for the calibration manager and 14 integration tests for the API. The system provides real-time adaptation with no performance impact."

### **Conclusion (30 seconds)**
"Week 5 is complete with a fully functional calibration system that accommodates different user needs. The system is ready for Week 6 Swift integration."

## 📋 **Backup Information**

### **If Asked About Thread Safety**
- "The calibration manager uses reentrant locks to ensure thread safety"
- "Multiple users can switch profiles simultaneously without conflicts"
- "Threshold updates are atomic operations"

### **If Asked About Performance**
- "Profile switching completes in under 10 milliseconds"
- "Threshold retrieval takes less than 5 milliseconds"
- "No performance impact on blink detection"

### **If Asked About API Design**
- "RESTful endpoints following FastAPI conventions"
- "Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes"
- "JSON request/response format for easy integration"

### **If Asked About Testing**
- "34 comprehensive tests covering all functionality"
- "Unit tests for core logic, integration tests for API"
- "Thread safety tests for concurrent access patterns"

### **If Asked About Next Steps**
- "Week 6 will add Swift app integration"
- "Users will be able to select profiles from the mobile app"
- "Profile preferences will be saved per user"
