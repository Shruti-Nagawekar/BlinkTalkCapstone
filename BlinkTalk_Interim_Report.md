# BlinkTalk Interim Report
## Assistive Communication System Based on Eye Blink Patterns

---

## Abstract

BlinkTalk is an innovative assistive communication system that enables users to communicate through intentional eye blinks, with a more intuitive custom sequence-to-word mapping approach. The system employs real-time eye tracking using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) calculation to detect and classify blinks as either short (S) or long (L) events, which are then processed by a sequence engine to match patterns against a predefined vocabulary. The architecture consists of a Python FastAPI backend that handles frame processing, blink classification, and sequence matching, integrated with a SwiftUI frontend optimized for iPhones that provides camera integration and user interface components. The system implements adaptive calibration profiles (slow, medium, custom) to accommodate individual user blink patterns and includes comprehensive error handling and fuzzy matching algorithms to improve translation accuracy. Extensive testing demonstrates successful blink detection, pattern recognition, and word translation capabilities, with the system achieving real-time processing performance suitable for practical communication applications. This interim report presents the current implementation status, technical architecture, and preliminary evaluation results of the BlinkTalk assistive communication system.

## 1. Introduction

BlinkTalk represents a significant advancement in assistive communication technology, designed to provide an intuitive and reliable communication method for individuals with limited mobility or speech capabilities. Traditional assistive communication systems often rely on complex interfaces or require extensive training, limiting their accessibility and adoption. BlinkTalk addresses these limitations by leveraging the natural human ability to control eye blinks, creating a communication system that is both intuitive and effective.

The system is built on the principle of mapping intentional eye blink patterns to meaningful words and phrases, replacing the complexity of Morse code with a more user-friendly sequence-based approach. This design choice makes the system more accessible to users with varying levels of technical proficiency and physical capabilities. The project aims to create a practical, real-world solution that can be easily deployed and used by individuals who need alternative communication methods.

The project demonstrates significant progress in core system components, including eye tracking, blink classification, sequence processing, and user interface development. The system's architecture is designed for scalability and maintainability, with clear separation between backend processing and frontend presentation layers.

### 2.2 Component Breakdown

The BlinkTalk system architecture is built around two primary component categories that work together to provide seamless communication capabilities. The backend components, implemented in Python with FastAPI, form the computational core of the system. The Eye Tracker component processes incoming camera frames and calculates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) values using advanced computer vision techniques, providing the fundamental data for blink detection. The Blink Classifier takes this continuous EAR data and converts it into discrete blink events, distinguishing between Short and Long blinks based on timing thresholds. The Sequence Engine processes these blink patterns and matches them against the predefined vocabulary to determine user intentions. The Calibration Manager handles user-specific timing thresholds and profiles, ensuring the system adapts to individual user patterns. Finally, the Translation API provides RESTful endpoints for word retrieval and system status.

The frontend components, built using Swift and SwiftUI, create the user-facing interface and interaction layer. Camera Integration captures and processes video frames using Apple's AVFoundation framework. The User Interface provides intuitive navigation and feedback to users through a carefully designed SwiftUI interface that prioritizes accessibility and ease of use. Profile Management allows users to create, modify, and switch between calibration profiles, ensuring the system adapts to individual user needs and preferences.

### 2.3 Data Flow

The system processes data through a well-defined pipeline that ensures reliable and real-time communication. The process begins with Frame Capture, where the iPhone camera captures video frames at an optimized rate of 5-10 FPS, balancing performance with accuracy. These frames then undergo Eye Tracking, where they are processed to extract EAR values using advanced facial landmark detection algorithms. The Blink Classification stage analyzes these EAR values to detect and classify blinks as either Short or Long events based on timing thresholds. Once blinks are classified, the Sequence Processing component collects these patterns and matches them against the predefined vocabulary to determine user intentions. The Translation stage converts completed sequences into meaningful words through API calls to the backend system. Finally, User Feedback is provided through the SwiftUI interface, displaying results to the user in an accessible and intuitive manner.

## 3. Eye Tracking and EAR Calculation

The eye tracking component forms the foundation of the BlinkTalk system, responsible for detecting and measuring eye movements to identify intentional blinks. The system employs the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) calculation, a well-established computer vision technique for blink detection.

### 3.1 Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) Theory

The Eye Aspect Ratio is a geometric measure that quantifies the degree of eye openness based on facial landmark positions. The EAR formula is defined as:

```
EAR = (|p2-p6| + |p3-p5|) / (2 * |p1-p4|)
```

Where p1-p6 represent specific facial landmarks around the eye:
- p1, p4: Horizontal eye corners
- p2, p3: Vertical eye landmarks (top)
- p5, p6: Vertical eye landmarks (bottom)

### 3.2 Implementation Architecture

The eye tracking system supports multiple implementation approaches, each optimized for different deployment scenarios and performance requirements. The DlibEyeTracker utilizes the dlib library with 68-point facial landmark detection, providing high accuracy for facial landmark detection through its sophisticated computer vision algorithms. This implementation requires pre-trained model files but delivers exceptional precision, making it particularly well-suited for desktop and server environments where computational resources are abundant and accuracy is paramount.

### 3.3 EAR Processing Pipeline


The system processes each camera frame through a sophisticated pipeline designed for real-time performance and accuracy. Frame Preprocessing begins the process by converting the input to grayscale and applying noise reduction techniques to improve landmark detection reliability. Face Detection then locates faces within the frame using the dlib detector. The EAR Calculation stage computes EAR values for both eyes and averages them to provide a single representative value for the frame. Finally, Threshold Comparison evaluates the computed EAR against the blink detection threshold, typically set at 0.25, to determine whether a blink is occurring.

---

## 4. Blink Classification and Event Processing

The blink classification system converts continuous EAR time series data into discrete, meaningful blink events that can be processed by the sequence engine. 

### 4.1 Blink Classification Algorithm

The classification system operates on a sophisticated state machine model that tracks blink states and timing to ensure accurate event detection. The Blink Detection States include an `is_blinking` boolean flag that indicates the current blink state, a `blink_start_time` timestamp that records when a blink began, and a `blink_start_ear` value that captures the EAR measurement at blink initiation. These states work together to provide comprehensive tracking of the blink detection process.

The system recognizes three distinct Event Types based on duration analysis. Short Blinks (S) are identified when the duration falls at or below the short_max_ms threshold, representing quick, intentional blinks. Long Blinks (L) are detected when the duration falls between the long_min_ms and long_max_ms thresholds, representing more deliberate, sustained blinks. Invalid Blinks are those with durations outside the acceptable ranges and are treated as noise, ensuring that only intentional communication blinks are processed by the system.

### 4.2 Timing Thresholds

The system uses configurable timing thresholds that can be adjusted based on user calibration:

| Threshold | Slow Profile | Medium Profile | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| short_max_ms | 500ms | 350ms | Maximum duration for short blinks |
| long_min_ms | 501ms | 351ms | Minimum duration for long blinks |
| long_max_ms | 1200ms | 900ms | Maximum duration for long blinks |
| symbol_gap_max_ms | 600ms | 450ms | Maximum gap between blinks in same word |
| word_gap_min_ms | 1500ms | 1100ms | Minimum gap to indicate word completion |

### 4.3 Gap Detection

The system implements sophisticated gap detection mechanisms to determine when sequences are complete and ready for translation. Symbol Gaps represent short pauses between blinks within the same word, detected when the time between blinks falls at or below the symbol_gap_max_ms threshold. These gaps indicate continuation of the current sequence, allowing users to build complex patterns like "S S L" for words such as "pain" without triggering premature translation. The system carefully monitors these timing intervals to ensure that related blinks are grouped together appropriately.

Word Gaps represent longer pauses that indicate word completion, detected when the time between blinks reaches or exceeds the word_gap_min_ms threshold. These gaps trigger sequence finalization and translation, signaling to the system that the user has completed their intended communication and the sequence should be processed against the vocabulary database.

## 5. Calibration Profiles and Threshold Adaptation

The calibration system is designed to accommodate individual user differences in blink patterns, ensuring accurate communication across diverse user populations. The system supports multiple calibration approaches to optimize performance for each user.

### 5.1 Calibration Profile Types

The calibration system supports three distinct profile types, each designed to accommodate different user needs and capabilities. The Slow Profile is specifically designed for users with slower, more deliberate blink patterns, featuring extended timing thresholds for all blink types to accommodate users who may have motor control limitations or prefer a more measured communication style. This profile provides increased tolerance for longer blinks, ensuring that users with varying physical capabilities can effectively use the system without being penalized for their natural blink patterns.

The Medium Profile represents the standard timing configuration for typical users, featuring balanced thresholds based on average user patterns observed during system development. This profile serves as the default option for new users. The Medium Profile is optimized for general population use, ensuring broad compatibility and ease of adoption.

The Custom Profile represents the pinnacle of personalization, providing user-specific thresholds derived from the interactive calibration process. This profile is tailored to each individual user's natural blink patterns, capturing the unique characteristics of their communication style and physical capabilities. 

### 5.2 Profile Management

The calibration manager provides comprehensive profile management capabilities that ensure users can effectively customize and utilize the system according to their individual needs. Profile Storage maintains custom profiles with user-specific settings, allowing each user to have their own optimized configuration that can be saved and retrieved as needed. Profile Switching enables users to seamlessly switch between different profiles during use, providing flexibility for users who may need different settings for different situations or times of day. Profile Validation ensures that all threshold values remain within reasonable ranges, preventing system errors and maintaining optimal performance by automatically checking and correcting any invalid settings.

## 6. Sequence Engine and Word Mapping

The sequence engine is the core component responsible for processing blink patterns and matching them to vocabulary words. This component implements sophisticated pattern matching algorithms to ensure accurate translation of user intentions.

### 6.1 Vocabulary Structure

The system uses a JSON-based vocabulary format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "$schema_version": "1.0",
  "meta": {
    "units": {
      "short_max_ms": 350,
      "long_min_ms": 351,
      "long_max_ms": 900
    },
    "gaps": {
      "symbol_gap_max_ms": 450,
      "word_gap_min_ms": 1100
    }
  },
  "vocab": [
    { "word": "yes", "pattern": "S S" },
    { "word": "no", "pattern": "L" },
    { "word": "thirsty", "pattern": "S L" },
    { "word": "hungry", "pattern": "L S" },
    { "word": "pain", "pattern": "S S L" },
    { "word": "tired", "pattern": "L L" },
    { "word": "light", "pattern": "S S S" },
    { "word": "temp", "pattern": "S L L" },
    { "word": "bored", "pattern": "L S S" },
    { "word": "feelings", "pattern": "L L S" }
  ]
}
```

### 6.2 Pattern Matching Algorithm

The sequence engine implements a sophisticated dual-approach pattern matching system that combines exact and fuzzy matching techniques to ensure optimal translation accuracy. Exact Matching provides direct comparison of sequence patterns. This approach serves as the primary matching method, providing immediate results when user input exactly matches vocabulary patterns.

Fuzzy Matching complements the exact matching approach by providing tolerance-based matching for user variations, addressing the reality that human communication involves natural inconsistencies and variations. This approach handles minor timing variations that may occur due to user fatigue, environmental factors, or individual differences in blink patterns. This dual approach significantly improves overall system reliability by ensuring that users can successfully communicate even when their patterns don't perfectly match the ideal sequences, making the system more forgiving and user-friendly.

### 6.3 Error Handling and Validation

The sequence engine implements comprehensive error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure system reliability and user experience. Invalid Sequences are those that don't match any vocabulary patterns, and the system handles these gracefully by providing appropriate feedback to users and maintaining system stability.

Frame Encoding utilizes Base64 encoding for API transmission, ensuring reliable data transfer between the Swift frontend and Python backend. Comprehensive camera error management handles various failure scenarios, from permission denials to hardware issues, providing graceful degradation and user feedback. The entire system is optimized for real-time processing, ensuring minimal latency between user actions and system responses.

### 7.3 User Interface Design

The interface follows comprehensive accessibility principles and user-centered design methodologies to ensure optimal usability for individuals with varying abilities and needs. The Black Screen Interface represents a deliberate design choice that removes live camera preview to avoid user disorientation, which can be particularly problematic for individuals with certain neurological conditions or visual sensitivities. 

## 8. Testing and Evaluation

The BlinkTalk system underwent a comprehensive testing process to ensure high reliability, accuracy, and performance across both the backend and frontend components. On the backend, implemented in Python, testing included unit, integration, and performance evaluations to validate each module within the blink detection and translation pipeline. Unit tests using the pytest framework verified individual functions for EAR calculation, blink classification, and calibration management. Mock testing was also performed to simulate computer vision behavior in the absence of camera hardware, ensuring that the system remained stable in various configurations.
